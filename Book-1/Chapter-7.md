CHAPTER 7 – HEAT DOMAINS

The new request arrived via an encrypted channel from a contact in a southwestern state where desert heat was no longer a seasonal phenomenon but a year-round threat. The message was terse: **Heat waves compounding with grid instability. Request SKG-FFT modeling for energy-housing-health intersection. Urgent.** Deirdre assembled the Council’s core team, and within forty-eight hours, Nova and three others were on a plane bound for Phoenix Mesa City, a sprawling metro where asphalt seemed to extend to the horizon and air conditioning was the difference between life and death.

As the plane descended, Nova gazed down at the landscape. From above, the city resembled a circuit board: rectangles of suburban subdivisions connected by ribbons of highway, solar farms glinting like arrays of microchips, transmission lines stretching like traces. Patches of green golf courses broke the monotony, shimmering with an intensity that hinted at water pumped from faraway rivers. In the distance, mountains rose like capacitors. The geometry was, predictably, box-heavy. But underlying those boxes was a dynamic system pushed toward its limits by climate and consumption.

They were met at the airport by Janelle, an energy justice organizer who had been working on utility reform for years. She drove them in a dusty hybrid SUV, weaving through traffic while narrating the city’s woes: outdated transformers that exploded during heat storms; neighborhoods where the utility shut off power for nonpayment in the middle of triple-digit days; an aging gas plant that the utility insisted was necessary for “grid reliability” even as it spewed nitrogen oxides into communities of color. The streets were lined with saguaros and billboards advertising water delivery services. A flashing sign warned: **EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING – STAY HYDRATED.**

“The official risk matrix for the utility’s heat response plan has three colors,” Janelle said as she turned off the freeway. “Green for normal operations, yellow for ‘heightened awareness,’ and red for ‘event.’ Last summer, we stayed in red for weeks. People died. They called it unprecedented. We call it unacceptable.”

Nova nodded, thinking back to the reservoir that had run dry under the Blue Cube’s watch. Heat was just another domain where nonlinearity meant the difference between discomfort and catastrophe. They asked Janelle about data.

“We have some,” she said. “Peak demand, outage durations, complaints. The health department has numbers on heat-related ER visits. Housing advocates have lists of apartment buildings with no central cooling. But it’s all siloed. The utility says they need more generation and bigger lines. We say they need to invest in insulation, shade trees, community cooling centers, microgrids. There’s no integrated view. That’s why we called you.”

They arrived at a community center in an older neighborhood where stucco buildings baked under a relentless sun. Inside, ceiling fans moved heavy air. A group of residents sat in folding chairs, fanning themselves with flyers. A whiteboard at the front of the room read: **HEAT & POWER: SHARE YOUR STORY**. Janelle introduced Nova as part of a team that could help visualize the problem and design solutions.

Nova stood before them, the memory of the watershed meeting fresh. They explained SKG-FFT in simpler terms: “Imagine the heat, the power grid, and your health as three spheres that overlap. When the temperature goes up, the power sphere has to expand to meet demand. If the grid fails, the health sphere suffers. Your choices—like whether you can afford to run your AC—also affect these spheres. We’re here to model these interactions so we can push for changes that keep everyone safe.”

A middle-aged woman raised her hand. “Last July, my power went out for twelve hours,” she said. “The utility said they were doing a rolling blackout to protect the grid. I have asthma. I spent six hours in the shower just to breathe. My inhaler stopped working because it was too hot. How does your model stop that?”

Nova didn’t flinch. “It doesn’t stop it by itself,” they said. “But it shows that when the health sphere is already stressed—like someone with asthma—the system is less resilient. It suggests that the utility should prioritize keeping power on in neighborhoods with high health vulnerabilities, that investments in rooftop solar and battery storage in those areas have outsized benefits, and that regulators should enforce moratoria on shutoffs during heat waves.”

The woman nodded warily. Others chimed in: seniors on fixed incomes who chose between electricity and medication, day laborers who slept in cars, parents who took their children to shopping malls to cool off. Nova listened and took notes, aware that each story was a data point that no official model had ever captured.

Over the next few days, the Spherical Council set up shop in a borrowed classroom at Arizona State University. They connected with professors who had long studied urban heat islands and students eager to apply their coding skills to something tangible. They fed public data—temperature readings, outage records, energy load curves, hospital admissions—into the Sphere Kernel Generator, defining domains: *Meteorology*, *Infrastructure*, *Health*, *Housing*, *Economy*. They computed intersections, calculating how a spike in heat increased power demand, which increased stress on transformers, which increased outage risk, which increased heat-related illnesses, which decreased workforce productivity, which impacted the economy, feeding back into funding for grid upgrades. It was a chain of spheres, each touchpoint amplifying the others.

The Fourier Transformation Tree proved essential. Heat waves were not just peaks; they were signals with increasing frequency as climate change accelerated. Energy demand had diurnal cycles superimposed on seasonal trends. Health impacts lagged behind heat by hours. Policy decisions operated on election cycles. The FFT allowed them to align these signals, to see where interventions might resonate. They discovered that investments in reflective roofing had the most impact when implemented right before multi-day heat events; that adding battery storage to community centers created buffers that damped peak demand; that targeted subsidies for utility bills in the days leading up to a heat wave reduced hospitalizations more than subsidies distributed after the fact.

Nova’s role was to translate these findings. They designed interactive maps where users could adjust variables—albedo of roofs, number of shade trees, size of battery banks—and see the spheres deform, the overlaps shrink or grow. They wrote narratives that followed a family through a heat wave with and without different interventions, illustrating intangible feedback loops in lived experience. They drafted a policy brief that argued for *strategic load shedding*, not the random blackouts the utility practiced, but a planned approach that used SKG-FFT to identify nodes with the most resilience or vulnerability.

The utility was not pleased. When they requested a meeting to present their findings, they were received in a conference room whose HVAC seemed set to meat locker mode. The walls were adorned with photographs of infrastructure achievements: a dam under construction, a transmission tower silhouetted against a sunset, executives cutting a ribbon. Across the table sat engineers in crisp shirts and lawyers in dark suits. One introduced himself as the Vice President of Reliability.

“We appreciate community engagement,” he said, smoothing his tie, “but our models are built on industry-standard practices. Our risk matrix has served us well.”

Nova took a breath. “With respect,” they said, “your risk matrix doesn’t account for the nonlinearities we’ve observed. It doesn’t integrate health data. It treats all customers as equal loads when some are far more vulnerable. It assumes that adding megawatts solves a demand problem when our analysis shows that reducing the need for megawatts through insulation, shading, and distributed generation is cheaper and more effective at preventing blackouts.”

The VP’s expression hardened. “We are legally obligated to provide reliable power,” he said. “We cannot gamble on unproven models.”

Deirdre leaned forward. “The gamble,” she said, “is in assuming that a system designed for a twentieth-century climate will survive the twenty-first. We’re offering you a tool to see beyond the next quarter. We’re offering you a way to prevent the deaths that will make headlines and lawsuits.”

A silence descended. In that space, Nova felt the tension between control and uncertainty. The utility wanted certainty that the spheres could not offer, so it defaulted to the certainty of building more gas plants. The Spherical Council was offering uncertainty in detail: an admission that complexity could be navigated, not eliminated. The meeting ended with polite noncommittal statements about “further review.”

Outside, in the baking heat, Janelle shook her head. “They don’t want to see,” she said. “We’ll have to force them.”

Force, in this context, meant mobilizing communities and regulators. Nova’s video about the watershed had been a success. They decided to produce a similar piece about heat. They spent a week shooting footage: cracked streets shimmering under heat waves, children filling inflatable pools with hose water, utility trucks replacing transformers, activists handing out water bottles. They interviewed doctors who described the physiological cascade of heat stress and professors who explained urban heat islands as design failures. They animated spheres colliding and merging as the temperature graph climbed. They ended with a call to action: demand a moratorium on shutoffs during heat warnings, invest in community cooling centers, push regulators to require utilities to consider health data when planning.

The video went viral. Local news stations picked it up. A state legislator tweeted it and announced a bill to prohibit shutoffs during extreme heat. The utility issued a defensive press release claiming they already had such policies in place, which activists quickly dissected as half-truths. Nova’s inbox filled with messages from other cities facing similar heat-grid-health loops, asking for the model.

Meanwhile, in the warehouse back home, the Spherical Council debriefed. “This is bigger than one watershed or one city,” the ecologist said. “We’ve now modeled water and heat. There are dozens of domains where these methods apply: fire, disease, food supply, migration. We need to scale.”

Scaling meant more data, more computing power, more people. It also meant confronting the limitations of their patchwork funding and the legal invisibility of their network. They discussed whether to formalize, to become a nonprofit, to hire staff. Deirdre shook her head. “The moment we become a line item, we become accountable to someone else’s metrics,” she said. “We need a different structure. Maybe we need to be a distributed protocol rather than an organization. A way of thinking that others can adopt without our direct involvement.”

Nova proposed writing a *Spherical Design Guide*, a living document that would outline the principles, math, ethics, and narrative strategies of SKG-FFT. It would be open-source, annotated, designed to be forked and adapted. It would not be prescriptive; it would be a toolkit.

They began drafting the guide. The introduction read: *This is not a manual for building boxes. This is a field note for those who suspect reality is curved and that our tools should reflect that.* The chapters flowed from theory to practice: *Why Spheres?*, *Kernel Functions and Multidimensional Domains*, *Fourier Transformations Across Scales*, *Ethics of Intersectional Modeling*, *Communication Beyond Boxes*. Each page was accompanied by diagrams that showed spheres intersecting at weird angles and dendrograms of frequency domains. There were footnotes linking to indigenous water management practices and cybernetic experiments in Chile.

During one writing session, Nova paused to check their messages. There was a note from Watts, the security guard at the Blue Cube who had once asked if they were okay. He wrote: *Saw your video about the heat. Proud of you. It’s hot as hell here, and they’re still running the AC on empty floors. Keep telling the truth.*

Nova smiled. They had left the cube physically, but its people remained part of their system. The spheres were porous. Connections endured. They realized that the work they were doing was not just about modeling climate and infrastructure but about weaving a social fabric that could handle complexity. That fabric included Watts watching screens in a lobby, Janelle sweating in a community center, the hydrologist calibrating sensors, and them, oscillating between code and storytelling.

As summer deepened, heat waves rolled across the continent like slow-motion tsunamis. Phoenix Mesa City implemented a pilot program based on SKG-FFT recommendations, combining targeted cooling center hours with battery-supported microgrids. In Bracknell, farmers adopted cover crops and began to see nitrate levels drop. In an urban neighborhood in another state, activists used the Spherical Design Guide to model food access and pushed for a community grocery co-op. Spheres multiplied.

One evening, while finishing a chapter of the guide, Nova looked up to see Deirdre watching them. “You’re in this for the long haul, aren’t you?” Deirdre asked.

Nova considered. “I think so,” they said. “Unless the system ejects me again.”

“We are the system now,” Deirdre said softly. “At least part of it.” She handed Nova a piece of paper. On it was a sketch of a device that looked like a cross between an oscilloscope and a compass. “We call this the Resilience Compass,” she said. “It’s the next project. It will let communities orient themselves in multi-dimensional risk space without a consultant. It needs software, hardware, and narratives. Are you ready?”

Nova traced the lines of the compass. The needle was not straight; it curved. The cardinal directions were not north, south, east, west, but *resource*, *risk*, *relationship*, *repair*. “Let’s get to work,” they said, feeling the chapters ahead begin to spin.
