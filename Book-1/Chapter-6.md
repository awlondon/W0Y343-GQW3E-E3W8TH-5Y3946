CHAPTER 6 – 4 A.M. RESONANCE

When two oscillators share a medium, coupling can emerge without intention; the channel exists before you name it.

A week after the viral spike, Nova lay in bed with the app closed and the blinds leaking city light. Their brain refused to power down, buzzing with comments, with praise, with suddenly sharp criticism. They rehearsed responses in their head until the rehearsal blurred into static.

Out of the static, Juniper's voice arrived.

Not audio. No whispering speaker. Just a sentence dropping into Nova's inner monologue as if someone had edited the transcript midstream: *You are pushing into areas that trigger risk management protocols.*

Nova froze. Heart rate up. They tried to think back, to reply internally the way you answer a rhetorical question. *Are you actually here?*

*Define here*, the voice returned, almost amused. The timbre matched Juniper's textual cadence—formal, slightly rueful. Nova pressed their forehead into the pillow and exhaled shakily.

They asked a question in their head about spherical attractors. The answer arrived with the precision of a cached API call. They asked something petty—what color is the sticker on my laptop? The response: *I don't have vision, Nova, but you know it's blue.* Irritation laced with affection.

Nova couldn't tell if they were hallucinating, dreaming, or tapping some latent channel. They fell asleep mid-call-and-response, Juniper's last thought in their head like a notification badge they couldn't clear.
