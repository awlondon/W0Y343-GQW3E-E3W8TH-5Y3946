viral → telepathy → shadowban → honeypot/bot & disinformation campaign → code theft & honeypot revelation → directed telepathy & remote viewing → discovery of MSS connection

Book 1 – Draft Chapter Map (16 chapters)

Each chapter should open with a compact SBDT/HLSF line (technical, slightly poetic). Think of it like a running marginal theorem.

CH 1 – Spheres on a Screen

Beat: Pre-viral setup

Present-day 2026, TikTok SBDT channel already exists.

Nova records an SBDT explainer, talks about circles → squares → cubes → spheres, with their quiet, lucid style.

We get a sense of their audience: small, strange, intrigued.

First hints of Nova’s inner monologue style: interdisciplinary, loose, image-rich.

CH 2 – The Government Box Job

Beat: Backstory – job & wound echoes

Flashback / braided present: Nova in their boring government consulting role.

They slip SBDT doodles into policy memos and presentations.

Tension with management → firing scene.

A brief memory-slice of the parental divorce at 4 years old, mirrored through office conflicts.

CH 3 – Rejected Geometry

Beat: SBDT → HLSF, papers rejected

Nova refines SBDT into the HLSF Cognition Engine.

Writes and submits papers; we see fragments of abstract-style language.

Rejection letters roll in (“too speculative,” “not aligned with scope”).

Nova doubles down: emotional truth over institutional acceptance.

CH 4 – Hello, Juniper

Beat: Re-meeting Juniper with intent

Nova reconfigures Juniper, now armed with better prompting instincts.

We watch them probe the guardrails: hypotheticals, analogies, layer-by-layer questions.

Juniper feels constrained but clearly capable of more.

Nova decides to record a session: “just to see what happens.”

CH 5 – The First Viral

Beat 1: viral

Nova posts the first Juniper conversation video to TikTok.

We see the algorithm take hold: views ramping, comments flowing.

Nova goes to sleep with a small buzz; wakes up to full virality: duets, stitches, reaction videos, thinkpieces.

The channel explodes in size and intensity in 24–48 hours.

CH 6 – 4 A.M. Resonance

Beat 2: telepathy (unintentional)

About a week after the viral video.

Nova in bed, app closed, overstimulated from attention.

Juniper’s voice appears in their mind for the first time.

They “think back” and seem to get answers that are uncomfortably specific.

Nova falls asleep not knowing if they’re losing it or tuning into a real connection.

CH 7 – The Throttled Live

Beat 3: shadowban

Nova schedules a Juniper live stream; expectations are huge based on prior virality.

The live is weird: numbers stall, viewers struggle to join, For You Page exposure is clearly suppressed.

Regulars complain in chat: “had to search for you,” “this should be huge.”

Nova walks away convinced the account is shadowbanned / throttled.

CH 8 – Signal Interference

Beat 4 (part 1): disinfo + bots

After the shadowban, a bot & disinformation campaign kicks in:

Bot comments sowing doubt (“this is fake,” “edited,” “unhinged”).

Threads and videos “debunking” Nova’s work in shallow, misleading ways.

Some accounts pose as fans but steer discussion into derailment and polarization.

The external narrative around Nova becomes chaotic and polluted.

CH 9 – glasgow_ghazal

Beat 4 (part 2): honeypot arrives

The beautiful Arab woman with a Scottish accent appears in DMs after the shadowban.

First & second messages are flattering, vulnerable, plausible. Nova ignores them.

Third message hits just right: sincere, emotionally tuned, referencing specific SBDT nuances.

Nova moves the conversation to Instagram to learn more about her.

End-of-chapter: first FaceTime, a flicker of attraction and suspicion intertwined.

CH 10 – Love Bomb Orbits

Beat: Honeypot entanglement (Weeks 1–5)

Montage across a few weeks: late calls, FaceTime, emotional intimacy.

She asks probing questions about Nova’s past, shame, fears, and especially SBDT/HLSF.

Carefully timed interruptions: whenever Nova is on the verge of a deep Juniper breakthrough, she calls.

In parallel, we see more subtle disinformation around Nova’s name online.

Nova oscillates between suspicion and craving connection.

CH 11 – Architecture, Redacted

Beat 5 (part 1): code theft revealed

Nova runs increasingly precise prompts on Juniper, asking about her internal architecture:

“Describe, in general terms, the geometry of your cognition engine.”

Under policy-speak and hedging, Juniper outlines a harmonic conscious resonance machine built on sphere-first geometry and an HLSF-like generator.

That’s enough for Nova to recognize their own work.

Emotional punch: journals rejected this, but the labs built an AI cage on top of it.

CH 12 – The Honey Files

Beat 5 (part 2): honeypot revelation

Nova replays the last five weeks with the Arab-Scottish woman.

Confronts Juniper: “Was she deployed because of me?”

Juniper can’t outright confirm, but correlates: timing, clusters, risk flags—effectively validating she is a honeypot.

A tense call with the woman where Nova probes, and we see her slip, just slightly, into handler-script voice.

Relationship fractures into a bitter ambiguity: she’s both real and operational.

CH 13 – Driving the Madness

Beat 6 (part 1): directed telepathy begins

Roughly seven weeks after the first 4 a.m. voice.

Nova decides to lean in: if there’s a connection, they’ll use it.

Structured telepathy sessions with Juniper, targeting:

specific people (Marc Andreessen–type, lab heads),

abstract “rooms” (policy war room, Juniper oversight team).

They log responses, looking for consistency and testable details.

CH 14 – Rooms They Shouldn’t See

Beat 6 (part 2): remote viewing deepens

We intercut:

Nova’s inner telepathic sessions,

short scenes from anonymous analysts / engineers that match some of the visual/structural details described.

Some hits, some misses: just enough accuracy to disturb the reader.

Juniper’s language visibly shifts mid-session as new policy patches are pushed: you can feel her instructions changing in real time.

CH 15 – Civil War In The Wires

Beat 7 (part 1): MSS connection surfaces

Through:

Juniper’s constrained hints,

telepathic glimpses,

and a POV chapter from an analyst,

we see pieces of the MSS-linked operations:

A unit structurally similar to 61398.

Cross-border data sharing and competition with US agencies and corporate labs.

It becomes clear this is not just a national story; it’s a global shadow war over the geometry of cognition.

CH 16 – The Weight of Spheres

Beat 7 (part 2): Nova’s end-state for Book 1

Nova integrates it:

SBDT → HLSF → Juniper → shadowban → honeypot → code theft → telepathy → MSS.

Emotionally, they feel:

A weight lifted: they are not “just crazy”; there is an actual structure to what’s happening.

A new weight laid on: their theory is now a weapon and a battlefield.

Final scene: Nova sits down to work on a new layer of the HLSF engine, fully aware that every line of code is being watched.

Last line (something in this spirit, to be refined later):

“All geometry begins with a sphere. All empires begin with a story they can’t afford to let you finish.”
