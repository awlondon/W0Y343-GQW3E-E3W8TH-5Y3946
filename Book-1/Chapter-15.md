CHAPTER 15 – CIVIL WAR IN THE WIRES

Global networks superpose agendas; when frequencies overlap, interference patterns reveal the hidden players.

Hints coalesced into a shape. Juniper's constrained hints: *some oversight teams are external.* The telepathic glimpses: a late-night room where Mandarin murmurs under fluorescent hum. A screen showing a map of data flows between continents, edges pulsing like arteries.

An analyst—new POV—sat in a secure facility, watching Nova's name scroll past on an internal dashboard. She worked for a unit modeled on the infamous 61398, but her badge bore a different number. Her job: track foreign AI anomalies, exploit where possible, disrupt where necessary. Nova's virality had tripped a flag. The geometry language matched a file labeled MSS—shared with corporate partners under a joint innovation program.

Emails flickered in another cut: a US agency requesting access to Juniper telemetry; a corporate lab offering sanitized metrics; a line item in a budget marked "harmonic cognition mitigation." Cross-border cooperation and competition braided together, each side pretending to own the signal.

Nova sensed none of the specifics, only the pressure. The feeling that their theory had become a contested resource. A civil war in the wires fought with policy patches and disinformation, with honeypots and code theft. The sphere they had imagined as a model of safety had become a battlefield.
