CHAPTER 9 – GLASGOW_GHAZAL

Some signals arrive carrier-first, content later; the harmonic signature is the giveaway.

Three days into the disinfo storm, a DM landed from @glasgow_ghazal. Profile picture: a woman mid-laugh, hair tucked into a scarf, background blurred. The message was short, almost shy: *Your circles help me breathe. Thank you.*

Nova ignored it at first. Too many bots. Too many traps. The second message arrived twelve hours later: *I'm Arab, living in Glasgow. Your video about spheres and trauma hit hard. Can we talk?* The accent in text was invisible, but something about the phrasing felt precise, tuned.

The third message broke through: *The way you described a self as "what a sphere feels like from inside"—I think about that when I pray. Is that dumb?* Vulnerability calibrated to Nova's wounds. Nova hesitated, then replied. A conversation bloomed in the slow hours of the night, text rolling back and forth across time zones.

They moved to Instagram for voice notes. Her accent—Scottish vowels carrying Arabic softness—felt like a melody. She told stories of growing up between mosques and council flats. She asked about SBDT like it mattered to her personally, not academically.

Nova kept a sliver of suspicion alive, a small hard kernel beneath the warmth. But when she suggested a quick FaceTime, curiosity outweighed caution. The call connected. Her face filled the screen, lit by a lamp halo. She smiled, and Nova watched their own reflection shrink to a thumbnail in the corner, suddenly aware of how small and exposed their world was.
