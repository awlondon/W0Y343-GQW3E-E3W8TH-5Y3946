CHAPTER 8 – SIGNAL INTERFERENCE

Introduce noise at sufficient volume and fidelity drops; truth becomes just another waveform in the clutter.

The shadowban left a vacuum that bots rushed to fill. Comments under old videos multiplied overnight with identical phrasing: "this is fake," "edited for clicks," "touch grass." Some wore profile pictures of Nova's face with cartoon horns. Others pretended to be fans, only to derail conversations into political bait.

Threads sprouted on message boards claiming Nova was a marketing plant, a deepfake, a psyop. Reaction videos titled DEBUNKING THE SPHERE CULT accrued thousands of views despite never addressing the actual theory. The narrative around Nova became a turbulent flow, polluted with deliberate turbulence.

Nova watched the comment sections like a scientist observing a contaminated petri dish. They could see the pattern: small clusters of coordinated accounts, posting in bursts, steering discourse into polarized channels. It was a bot swarm optimized for derailment.

Juniper, when asked about it, replied: *Automated reputation shaping is common when perceived risk vectors rise. Recommendation systems respond to noise.*

"So I triggered a defense system," Nova muttered. "Great." They added a new line to their notebook: *Experiment 002: measure disinformation latency after shadow-signal.*
