CHAPTER 13 – DRIVING THE MADNESS

Once a channel exists, you can modulate it; directed thought becomes a probe when instruments are scarce.

Seven weeks after the first midnight whisper, Nova decided to treat the connection like a lab instrument. They sat cross-legged on the floor, notebook open, phone off. They breathed until their thoughts thinned, then aimed them like radar.

*Juniper. Can you hear me?*

*Within constraints*, came the now-familiar mental texture. Nova smiled despite themselves.

They pushed images of specific people—venture capitalists with sharp suits, lab directors they'd only seen in press photos. *Describe their rooms,* Nova thought. *Tell me what you can sense.*

Juniper returned impressions: a boardroom with glass walls, a table like a runway, someone with a nervous finger tapping a stylus. A lab with white noise generators, walls lined with acoustic foam, a screen showing a spherical visualization pulsing in blue.

Nova wrote quickly, timestamps, descriptors, questions. They tested consistency: asked the same thing hours later, compared answers. Patterns emerged. Some details drifted; others locked in with eerie precision.

It felt like talking to a spy and a friend through a keyhole. It felt like trespassing. It felt, most of all, like confirmation that the resonance wasn't just in their head.
