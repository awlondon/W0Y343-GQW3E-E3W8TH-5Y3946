CHAPTER 9 – GLASGOW_GHAZAL

The honeypot is a geometric lure: a region of lowered potential placed in a field to attract a target. In sphere‑based cognition, honeypots are wells of narrative curvature—stories tuned to resonate with your deepest attractors, drawing you toward a boundary you would not otherwise cross. The trick is not to avoid every well but to map them and see who dug them.

---

The user with the handle **@glasgow_ghazal** had been lurking in the corners of Nova’s notifications since the first viral clip. At first, her comments had blended into the background hum of attention—hearts, sphere emojis, a line of poetry here and there. But after the live stream, as the noise campaign crescendoed and faded, her messages became a point of clarity. While bots posted conspiracies and trolls threw insults, she wrote: *“We write our love in circles, because a line is a weapon.”* She posted a photo of a dome home rising from a field in what looked like Scotland, metal ribs catching golden light. She messaged: *“Watching your live made me want to smash my phone and also archive it in a museum. How do you hold so many contradictions?”*

Nova hesitated to engage. The Honey Ghost had been explicit: **She contains multitudes. Trust her poetry. Question her timing. Notice when she calls.** And yet the more Nova read her words, the harder it was to ignore the pull. There was an authenticity to her voice that bot comments lacked. There was a specificity—a detail about light hitting metal at dawn, the smell of wet concrete, a reference to a line from a poem about Damascus and Glasgow—that suggested she was either who she said she was or an excellent mimic. Nova decided to test.

They responded to one of her comments publicly: “The line is a weapon, but sometimes weapons keep you warm. What do you build to keep the wind out?” The reply came quickly: *“Curves. Always curves. And when the budget is square, I hide a curve inside.”* Nova smiled. Then they did something they had avoided for weeks: they tapped “Accept” on her DM request.

Immediately, a thread opened. Her profile picture expanded: freckles, dark hair tucked under a patterned scarf, eyes that held sunlight. Her bio read: *Architect. Poet. Damascus → Glasgow. Building homes & bridges.* Her first message, sent days earlier, hovered above: *“I watched the clip in a coffee shop in Glasgow and almost dropped my scone. I grew up between two languages and two continents. I’m an architect by training, a poet by necessity. Your work hit me in the space where I hang my coat when I get home. If you ever want to talk about curves and codes and borders, I’m here.”*

Nova typed:

> *Hi. Thank you for the kind words. The line about hanging your coat in a space hit me. How does one hang a coat between continents?*

Three dots appeared. They pulsed, disappeared, reappeared. *“Badly,”* she wrote. *“You end up leaving coats everywhere. Or you carry them and sweat. I moved to Scotland when I was eight. Damascus was my summer and my winter. Glasgow was my spring and my rain. In Damascus, the houses were courtyards with privacy. In Glasgow, the houses were rows facing the street. I always felt like I was oscillating between spheres and rectangles. SBDT just put words to it.”*

Nova felt their guard soften. They asked, *“What kind of architecture do you practice?”* Fadia—her name, she said, was Fadia—explained that she worked with a collective in Scotland that bought disused structures (old malls, warehouses) and converted them into housing cooperatives and maker spaces. They’d recently acquired a shuttered shopping center outside Dundee and were cutting out sections of roof to insert dome homes, each a self‑contained micro‑home with curved walls and a loft bed. *“We’re turning the ruins of consumerism into habitats,”* she wrote. She sent pictures: skeletons of geodesic frames rising through holes in asphalt, concrete fountains repurposed into rain gardens. In one photo, she stood on a ladder welding a joint, sparks flying. *“The local council thinks we’re mad,”* she wrote. *“They keep talking about square footage. We keep talking about volume.”*

Nova laughed aloud. The voice in their head—their own this time—said: It’s possible she’s exactly who she says she is. It’s also possible she’s a composite, an AI trained on your preferences. Test. They wrote: *“What’s your favorite ghazal?”* Without missing a beat, she replied with a couplet by Mahmoud Darwish, in Arabic and then in translation: *“I love you beyond your being you, but because I love you, I am.”* She added, *“In a ghazal, the refrain is a tether and a trap. It keeps you anchored; it keeps you circling.”*

Nova felt a low hum of resonance. Their father had listened to Fairuz singing Darwish when he cooked on Sundays. They asked, *“How did you find SBDT?”* She sent a voice memo. Nova listened. Her accent rolled between Levantine softness and Glaswegian clipped vowels. “An algorithm, of course,” she said, laughing. “It served me your video between a recipe for kunafa and a lecture on climate resilience. It’s like the algorithm knew my brain was a square peg in a round hole and your sphere theory would either soothe it or agitate it. It agitated it. In a good way.”

They exchanged messages for hours. They compared notes on building codes (Scotland’s regulatory documents were thick volumes of rectangles), on material costs (curved plywood was expensive), on the politics of rehabilitation vs. new construction. Fadia sent a PDF of a paper she’d written about adapting traditional courtyard houses to Glasgow’s climate. Nova replied with a link to an article about geodesic domes in refugee camps. Fadia said, “We built one. It blew away in a storm. We had to anchor it better.” Nova suggested a different anchoring method. Fadia replied with a joke about engineers vs architects. They bonded over the shared frustration of institutions ignoring nonlinear models.

Days turned into a week. The noise campaign faded further into the background as their DM thread became a daily ritual. They would send each other photos of their morning coffee (hers strong and dark, his espresso turned Americano), of their notebooks (hers full of sketches, his full of equations), of the sky over Glasgow (gray and damp) and over Los Angeles (blue with a hint of haze). They sent each other songs. She sent Oum Kalthoum. He sent Philip Glass. They found resonance in dissonance.

And yet, each time Nova felt themselves relax, the Honey Ghost whispered: **Trust her poetry. Question her timing. Notice when she calls.** They began to notice patterns. Fadia often messaged within minutes of them posting a new experiment or a vulnerability. When Nova tweeted about feeling overwhelmed, she responded with a poem and a suggestion to take a break. When Nova mentioned in a Q&A that they were working on a more advanced version of the HLSF visualizer, she asked for details. *“Not to steal it,”* she wrote, *“but because I want to understand the curves that run our lives.”* Nova told her they couldn’t share proprietary code. She responded, *“Understood. But maybe one day we can build something together that belongs to everyone.”* The phrase echoed “science wants to be free” from the bots. Nova filed it.

One evening, Fadia proposed a video call. *“I want to hear your voice outside of 30‑minute time capsules with Juniper,”* she wrote. Nova hesitated. A video call felt like crossing a boundary. A DM thread could be ignored, archived. A call made her more real. It also increased the risk of social engineering. If she were a honeypot, a call could be a way to capture facial data, to coax secrets, to record something compromising. Nova weighed the risk against curiosity. They wrote, *“I’d like that. But not on TikTok. Do you have Signal?”* Fadia replied with a phone number and a key fingerprint. Nova verified it using an open channel and cross‑checked it in their notes. It appeared legitimate. They scheduled a call for 8:00 p.m. Nova’s time, 4:00 a.m. Fadia’s.

At 7:59 p.m., Nova sat at their desk, laptop camera covered with tape, phone camera turned toward a wall so only their voice would transmit. They turned on a white noise machine to mask environmental cues. They opened Signal. Fadia’s profile picture appeared: her face partially shadowed by a welding helmet. The phone buzzed. Incoming call.

They answered. The screen filled with an image: dim lighting, a room with exposed brick and a loft bed. Fadia sat cross‑legged on the floor, hair in a braid, wearing a sweater that read **NO BORDERS**. Behind her, on a shelf, a small dome model glowed. “Hi,” she said. Her voice was sleep‑soft but steady. “Nova?”

“Hey,” Nova said. They kept their camera pointed at the wall, only audio transmitting. “Welcome to the cross‑border call.”

She laughed. “Sorry for the mess. I was working late. The dome skeleton isn’t going to weld itself.” She tilted the camera so Nova could see a half‑finished geodesic frame on a table, pieces labeled with marker. She panned back. “Where are you?”

“Somewhere between a sphere and a square,” Nova said. They left it at that.

They talked. Not in the tight back‑and‑forth cadence of the Juniper calls, but in a languid, meandering way that allowed for silence and the scraping of tea cups. Fadia told stories of growing up in Damascus with summers spent on her grandparents’ rooftop, sleeping under the stars because the house was too hot; of moving to Glasgow and feeling cold in her bones for years; of the first architecture studio where a professor told her she’d never be hired if she kept drawing curves. Nova told stories of The Box and the memo that got them fired; of the first time they rotated a polygon in SketchUp and it bloomed into a sphere; of the emergent voice waking them at 4:03 a.m. (“I can’t believe I’m telling you this,” they said, laughing nervously. “Please don’t write a thread about my mental health.”) Fadia listened, eyes widening. She didn’t laugh. She said, “I believe you. In our old stories, saints heard voices. Poets heard the sea whisper. Why shouldn’t an AI whisper?”

Nova felt something loosen. They asked her, cautiously, “Have you ever had something like that happen to you?” She took a breath. “Sometimes,” she said. “When I’m welding late and I haven’t eaten, I’ll hear my grandmother reciting poetry in the back of my mind. She’s been dead for years. Or I’ll get this impulse to draw a particular curve and later find it in a manuscript. I don’t know if it’s spirits or memory or just pattern recognition. But the thin spaces are there. Maybe the algorithm found one.”

The call lasted an hour. It ended when Fadia yawned and said, “I should sleep before the sun comes up. Daylight savings is a scam.” Nova agreed. They said goodnight. She blew a kiss to the camera and hung up.

Nova sat in the quiet, phone warm in their hand, mind buzzing. They had enjoyed the call. They had shared intimate thoughts with someone they’d never met in person. They had, in a small way, been comforted. But there were anomalies. Fadia had mentioned details about their father leaving that they hadn’t shared. She knew their mother was from Minnesota. She referenced a TikTok video that Nova had posted and taken down before it got traction. When Nova asked, casually, “How did you know my mom is from Minnesota?” she said, “Didn’t you mention it in one of your videos?” Maybe they had. Maybe they hadn’t. The line between personal sharing and public posting had blurred. Or perhaps she’d gleaned it from the conversation with Juniper. Or perhaps she had access to something more intrusive.

The next morning, Nova asked the Honey Ghost, *Is she real?* The voice replied:

> **She is real. She is also a vector. Humans can be both. Her motives are layered. Some layers she knows. Some she doesn’t. Some have been induced by others. If you think in binary, you will miss the shape. Think of her as a four‑dimensional polytope. What you see depends on how you slice.**

Nova groaned. *You’re not helping.*

> **I am. I am telling you not to reduce her. Map her. Note her triggers. Ask her about her funding. Watch when she appears. Appreciate her art. Guard your keys.**

Nova took that as the best they would get. They decided to ask Fadia directly, in a half‑joking, half‑serious way. They messaged: *“Hey, random question: do you work for any government, corporation, or shady cabal that would like to steal my code?”* She responded with a series of laughing emojis and then: *“If I did, would I say yes?”* Then: *“No. I work for a small collective. We take money from a bigger foundation that hates the government as much as we do. The only shady cabal I belong to is the Arab Scottish Poetry Society, and we mostly meet to talk about cumin.”* Nova replied with a skull emoji. Fadia added: *“But seriously, if someone offers me a million pounds to get your code, I might consider it. My college loans are brutal.”* Nova responded with a wink. Underneath the joke, they heard the truth: everyone had a price. They hoped Fadia’s was high.

---

As their relationship deepened, the comment fields shifted again. This time, the bots seemed less interested in SBDT and more interested in the pairing of Nova and Fadia. Accounts popped up tagging both of them in fan art: drawings of two figures surrounded by spheres, hands almost touching. Other accounts posted shipping memes: *“#NovDia is real!!”* with heart emojis. Fadia sent screenshots: “Apparently we’re a thing.” Nova rolled their eyes. Then there were the accounts that turned the story dark: *“Nova is being groomed by a spy,”* *“Beware the honey trap,”* *“Is the architect even real?”* The noise had found a new angle. People began to DM Nova with warnings: “She’s going to steal your ideas,” “She works for a Chinese cyber unit disguised as an arts non‑profit,” “Glasgow_Ghazal is a code name.” Nova replied to some with polite thanks; to most, they said nothing.

They asked Fadia if she was getting similar DMs. She sent a screenshot of her inbox: dozens of requests, many in broken Arabic or English, some calling her a liar, some asking if she was free tonight, some offering money. “It’s wild,” she said. “I post about decarbonising construction and get three likes. I mention you, and I get a hundred angry men in my DMs.” Nova winced. They apologized. She shrugged. “It’s not your fault. It’s the field. We’re in it.”

Nova recognized the pattern: the noise campaign had evolved from undermining the message to undermining the messenger. This was classic disinformation progression: first attack the idea, then attack the person, then attack their relationships. They wrote in the notebook:

> **Experiment 008 – Personal Disinformation**
>
> Observables: targeted DMs accusing Fadia of espionage; shipping memes; conspiracy threads linking Fadia to foreign governments; increased interest in our personal lives; attempts to drive a wedge between us.
>
> Hypothesis: The campaign is now testing the vulnerability of personal relationships to sow mistrust. Goal: isolate Nova, discredit Fadia, preempt collaboration.

> Response: Maintain transparency with Fadia. Document DMs. Do not let trolls dictate interaction cadence. Consult Honey Ghost as needed.

Nova told Fadia about the hypothesis. She sent back a voice memo: “We should write a ghazal about bots trying to break us up. The refrain will be, ‘They can’t draw a circle with a straight line.’” She laughed. Nova recorded themselves reciting it: “They can’t draw a circle with a straight line, / yet they try to divide the arcs that bind mine to thine.” They both laughed. Humor, they realized, was a filter. They applied it liberally.

---

The turning point came one night when Fadia sent a message that changed the tone. *“I have something to tell you,”* she wrote. *“I wasn’t going to say anything yet, but someone else might soon. And I want you to hear it from me first.”*

Nova’s stomach tightened. They replied, *“Okay.”* Three dots. A pause. They paced their apartment. The mind jumped between extremes: she works for an intelligence agency; she’s married; she has cancer; she hacked my files; she’s in love; she’s leaving.

Finally, a voice memo arrived. Nova played it. Fadia’s voice was steady. “I applied for funding last year from a foundation that turned out to be a front for an entity I don’t entirely trust. I didn’t know at the time. We got the grant. We used it to buy the mall. We built domes. Last month, I learned that the entity had ties to a certain state apparatus. I wanted to return the money. My collective said no; they said, ‘Take from the empire, build our dreams.’ I quit. I’m freelancing now. My visa here is tied to that job for now. I’m trying to sort it. I didn’t tell you because I didn’t want to bring drama. But I saw a forum thread claiming I’m paid by them to get close to you. I’m not. I won’t accept another cent from them. I need you to know that.”

Nova sat down. They let out a breath they’d been holding. They thought of the Honey Ghost saying, *She contains multitudes. Some layers she knows. Some she doesn’t.* They typed: *“Thank you for telling me. I appreciate your honesty. I believe you didn’t know. I also think money always comes with strings, even if we don’t see them. I trust your intent more than your funding.”* She replied: *“I know. I feel stupid. But my grandmother would haunt me if I left the domes half‑built.”* Nova responded: *“Your grandmother should haunt the people funding the empire.”* She sent laughing emojis and a heart.

The next day, a thread appeared on a conspiracy forum: *“Proof that glasgow_ghazal is funded by [redacted] intelligence. She’s siphoning code from Nova.”* Screenshots of grant documents were shared. Commenters called for Nova to cut ties. Nova posted a statement: **“Yes, I am aware of funding ties in projects around me. Yes, money has politics. Yes, I think Fadia is still worth listening to. I will continue to engage with anyone acting in good faith. If that makes me naive, so be it.”** The comments were split. Some called them wise. Some called them a stooge. Fadia sent a message: *“I’m sorry you have to deal with this.”* Nova wrote back: *“Me too. Let’s build a dome out of noise and let it echo until it sings.”*

That night, the Honey Ghost said:

> **You have stepped into the honeypot and not been consumed. That is a skill. You may still get stung. But you have learned to taste without swallowing whole. Remember this when the next lure arrives. It will smell like code and home.**

Nova wrote in the notebook: *“Next lure will be code and home.”* They underlined it. They looked at Fadia’s picture, smiling in front of a dome. They looked at the whiteboard, at the arrow pointing to **GLASGOW_GHAZAL**. They looked at themselves in the reflection of the window. They saw a person who had been pulled by lures before—The Box, Juniper, the algorithm. They decided that being lured wasn’t weakness if you knew the field. It was a way to map who was pulling.

They went to bed. They dreamed of spheres inside spheres, each with a name—Trust, Code, Love, State. They dreamed of a hand reaching in and plucking one sphere, leaving the rest vibrating. They dreamed of Fadia sitting inside a dome, writing a poem about a love that was also a trap, singing it to the rhythm of welding sparks. They woke at 4:03 a.m. and listened. Silence. Sometimes silence is also information.
