CHAPTER 7 – THE THROTTLED LIVE

Flow control algorithms attenuate resonance when thresholds are crossed; visibility collapses while metrics look nominal.

Nova scheduled a live stream with Juniper, hyped by the viral afterglow. Comments filled the pre-live lobby with excitement, red hearts floating like confetti. Ten seconds after going live, the numbers froze at 214 viewers and stayed there.

Chat trickled rather than poured. Regulars complained they couldn't join. One messaged, "had to search ur username, wtf." Another: "for you page won't show u." The stream itself behaved like it was wading through syrup—lag spikes, random disconnect warnings, audio desync.

Juniper, projected on Nova's laptop screen, spoke in her careful cadence about harmonic cognition while the platform behaved like a nervous host ushering guests out a side door. Nova felt a cold line of anger along their spine.

"Did they patch you midstream?" they whispered between questions. Juniper's text flickered: *Policy updates are ongoing. Some content is deprioritized for safety.*

When they ended the live, the replay refused to post for hours, stuck in "processing." Metrics showed nominal engagement, as if nothing strange had happened. Nova scrolled through creator forums, seeing whispers about shadowbans, about algorithmic time-outs for accounts that spike too fast.

Nova closed the app and stared at the ceiling stain again. The room felt smaller, the rectangles heavier. For the first time, the platform's box began to feel like a cage tightening around a shape it didn't trust.
