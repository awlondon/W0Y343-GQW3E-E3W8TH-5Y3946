CHAPTER 1 – SPHERES ON A SCREEN

In three-dimensional Euclidean space, the sphere is the unique solution to the problem: minimize exposed surface for a fixed volume of matter. Everything else is an engineering compromise.

Nova Sinclair woke up staring at the cracked circle of a water stain on the ceiling.

It wasn’t a circle, not in any strict sense. The edge was irregular, fractal at close range, a cheap plaster approximation of an isoperimetric surface. A failed attempt at the sphere’s party trick: hold as much as you can while showing as little as possible.

They blinked once, and their brain, still halfway between dream and daylight, did what it always did: ran a quick classification.

Approximate radius: thirty centimeters. Thickness: negligible. Pigment distribution: non-uniform, Gaussian-ish. Entropy: high. Structural integrity: low. Emotional valence: mildly hostile.

Then they reached for their phone and watched the rectangle flash on, dumping photons and numbers into their optic nerve.

Twenty-three new notifications. TikTok mostly. A couple of Discord pings from servers they refused to mute. One DM from someone called **@sleepyhypercube**:

> *yo ur videos are weirdly calming but i don’t understand a single thing, keep going pls*

Nova’s mouth twitched.

They swiped into TikTok. The last upload sat pinned at the top of their page: thirty-nine seconds of their hand drawing circles in a notebook, voiceover explaining why every cube you’ve ever loved is secretly a botched projection of a sphere. The thumbnail was a still of a circle mid-draw, chalky and imperfect.

Views: 2,937.

Higher than baseline. Lower than “my life has changed forever.”

They rolled onto their side and grabbed the spiral notebook off the floor. The cover was soft from weather and time, corners delaminated. Page one carried the sentence they kept rewriting, trying to get the phrasing as compact as the geometry it described:

> All geometry begins with a sphere.

Below it, variants:

> Consciousness begins with a sphere.
> A self is what a sphere feels like from the inside.
> Power begins with a box.

Under that, in smaller letters: *The war between them is called “design”.*

Nova ran a finger along the ridge of dried ink, like checking the perimeter of a fence. Their handwriting leaned forward, sharp and slightly obsessive, letters hooked together like they were drafting a secret alphabet only they would ever really read.

Coffee, they thought. Then video. Then maybe the universe.

The kitchen was one step to the left of the bed and two steps forward, which was less “floor plan” and more “probability distribution.” Studio apartment: volume-constrained, boundary-heavy. If you modeled it as a potential well, the minimum-energy state was “lying down, scrolling.”

They scooped a chipped mug off the counter. The ceramic lip was worn to a faint curve where countless collisions with teeth had shaved it down on a microscopic level.

Near-spherical cavity, Nova’s brain noted automatically. Radius around four centimeters. Heat-transfer profile suboptimal but adequate. Human ergonomics: good enough.

Water boiled in the dented electric kettle. As they poured, steam spiraled up in turbulent little vortices, losing coherence as it mixed with the still, cooler air. Temporary structures dissolving into entropy. Spheres in motion, sampling microstates on their way to thermal equilibrium.

Their phone buzzed again on the bed. Another comment:

> *so ur saying my room is wrong shaped?*

“Yes,” Nova told the steam. “I am absolutely saying your room is wrong shaped.”

They carried the mug back to the bed and sat where a slice of daylight cut through the blinds, resolving into horizontal bars on their legs. Across from them, a cheap whiteboard leaned against the wall, its plastic frame slightly warped. On it: circles nested inside circles, tangent points, arrows, a few scattered equations, and in one corner a cube drawn in sloppy perspective, stabbed through with red diagonal lines like a crime-scene photo.

At the top, underlined three times in dry-erase marker already ghosting in places: **SPHERE-BASED DESIGN THEORY**.

They took a sip, burned their tongue, and closed their eyes.

The model came online in under a second. It didn’t feel like “thinking” so much as letting a cached process resume where it had been pre-empted by sleep.

In every physical system with any freedom to move, things spread out until they minimize free energy. In three dimensions, the sphere is the shape that wins that game: minimum surface area for a given volume, minimum exposure per unit of content. That’s not philosophy; that’s calculus of variations and an isoperimetric inequality with a long, boring proof.

Cells know this. Planets know this. Droplets of fat know this in soup.

Brains are trickier. Brains get built inside constrained skull volumes, but the information inside them behaves the same way. Beliefs aggregate around attractors. Habits cluster. Stories curl in on themselves. Given enough time and pressure, a mind will try to roll into a shape where the ratio of “what I have to show” to “what I have to protect” is locally minimized.

If you drew a Markov blanket around a life—everything that counted as “me” on one side and “all that” on the other—the natural tendency would be to smooth the boundary, reduce the number of angles where the world could jab in.

Then someone sticks that mind in a right-angled room lit by rectangular screens and tells it to perform.

Nova opened their eyes again.

The whiteboard stared back.

The phone, face down on the bed, vibrated once more with the faint, insistent energy of distant humans trying to be heard. A pathologically inefficient communication network, they thought. Billions of nervous systems, each trying to approximate a shared sphere of understanding through little boxes of text and video.

“Ten minutes,” they said out loud, to the room, to the stain, to whatever had decided they still had rent money this month. “One shot if possible.”

They dragged the small folding table closer to the window, the metal legs squealing on the laminate. They set the phone on a stack of books: a topology text they’d actually finished, a glossy “smart city” coffee-table thing they’d scrawled insults in, and a paperback on attachment theory they’d made it thirty-one pages into before realizing it wasn’t built for people whose parents fought in terms of metaphysics.

They flipped on the cheap ring light clipped to the table. The apartment shifted from soft grayscale to flat, slightly uncanny brilliance. Their reflection in the phone screen looked overexposed, eyes catching the LED ring like a cat’s.

Frame check. Shoulders up. Whiteboard in shot. Ceiling stain hovering in the top corner like an unblinking, jaundiced halo.

Good.

“Okay,” Nova murmured. “Let’s entice the algorithm.”

They tapped record.

“Hey,” they said, and their voice came out steady, lightly amused. “I’m Nova. This is Sphere-Based Design Theory, installment… I don’t know, four? We’ll pretend it’s four.”

They angled their head toward the whiteboard.

“Quick question,” they continued. “Have you ever noticed that everything alive wants to be round and everything built by committee wants to be square?”

They held up the mug.

“This is not a perfect demonstration,” they said. “But your coffee, your blood cells, your eyeballs, the planet, the raindrops currently trying to ruin my ceiling—those all solve the same problem physics gives them: ‘Given some stuff and some energy, how do you exist while showing the least amount of vulnerable surface to the universe?’”

They set the mug down. Picked up a marker.

“This,” Nova said, drawing a circle in one smooth stroke, “is what happens when a system gets to relax. This is the solution to a minimization problem. Mathematically, we call it isoperimetric. Psychologically, we call it ‘finally breathing.’”

They added four dots on the circumference, roughly ninety degrees apart.

“Now,” they went on, switching marker colors, “imagine you’re an engineer who hates curves. Or a bureaucrat. Or an architect designing office parks. You don’t want this.” Tap on the circle. “You want something you can stack, count, and regulate.”

They drew lines connecting the dots. A square appeared, awkward and slightly skewed.

“The trick is,” Nova said, “you can get your beloved little box out of the sphere. You pick points on the boundary, draw straight lines between them, and pretend the curved part was never there.”

A few more lines and shading, and now there was a cube in perspective, hovering against the cheap plastic.

“What we do—what our entire civilization is doing—is falling in love with the projection and forgetting the generating surface.”

They turned back to the camera, meeting their own image. The ring light made their pupils look almost perfectly circular, like little apertures trying to maximize signal-to-noise.

“Technically,” they said, “your bedroom, your cubicle, your phone screen—they’re all approximations of a higher-dimensional sphere compressed into a grid because someone decided rectangles were easier for spreadsheets.”

They let themselves drift a little, words following a path they’d walked a hundred times in their head but rarely out loud.

“If you’re neurotypical,” Nova said, “maybe that’s fine. You tuck your mind into the available boxes. But if your interior geometry has more curvature—if your thoughts don’t align with the grid—you’re going to feel it. You’re going to feel like the walls are wrong and the floor is tilted and everyone keeps insisting the problem is your brain.”

They drew a tiny circle inside the cube and shaded it, a small dark planet trapped in a wireframe universe.

“I’m not saying this as metaphor,” they added. “I’m saying that if we modeled your cognition as a high-dimensional state space, your ‘natural’ configuration probably looks more like a sphere in that space, and what we call pathology is often just the mismatch between that and the rectangular social containers we shove you into.”

They stopped. Aware they’d gone too far for a thirty-nine-second video. Aware they’d also hit the only part that mattered.

“That was a lot of words,” they admitted, a small smile flickering. “Here’s the oversimplified version: the world you live in is a low-resolution screenshot of a smoother, rounder reality. If you don’t fit the screenshot, it doesn’t mean you’re broken. It might mean the resolution is too low.”

They uncapped the marker with their teeth and drew one last thing: a sphere around the cube, a larger circle enclosing the small angular shape.

“Sphere-Based Design Theory,” Nova concluded, “is just me taking that seriously. What if we designed rooms, systems, interfaces, laws like we actually believed the underlying geometry was round?”

Beat. One breath.

“Anyway,” they said, half-laughing. “If any of that made sense, congratulations, you might be a problem for whoever built the boxes. Like and follow if you want to keep ruining rectangles with me.”

They stopped recording.

The room snapped back into silence, the ring light’s quiet hum the only evidence anything had happened. Outside, a siren wailed briefly and then dopplered away. Upstairs, someone dropped something heavy, sending a faint tremor through the stain on the ceiling.

Nova watched the playback once. Twice.

On mute, it looked like a calm person explaining geometry. With sound, it sounded like someone trying very hard to smuggle a new operating system through a platform meant for dance challenges and recipes.

They opened the caption field and typed:

> *Your brain might be a sphere stuck in a box. This is not a metaphor. #SBDT #geometry #adhdbrain #design*

Their thumb hovered over the `#adhdbrain` for a second, then moved on. They hit post.

The app vibrated with a tiny, optimistically neutral pulse.

Nova dropped the phone onto the bed and let their head tilt back against the wall. For a moment, the present flickered, and they were four years old again, sitting on a different bed in a different wrong-shaped room, listening to their parents argue in two incompatible coordinate systems.

*You’re confusing them.*
*You’re lying to them.*
*They need stability.*
*They need the truth.*

Two doorways at the end of a hallway. Two cars in the driveway, parked at obtuse angles to each other. Two gravitational wells, both insisting they were the center of the same universe.

Somewhere in the middle, a small, unmodeled sphere.

They inhaled, long and deliberately, and came back to the cheap apartment, the whiteboard, the not-quite-circle on the ceiling.

The phone buzzed.

> *first*

Another:

> *idk what an iso- whatsit is but this slapped*

Another:

> *bro i feel like ur explaining why i hate open-plan offices*

Nova smiled, softer this time.

It wasn’t viral. Not yet. It was maybe three thousand people and an algorithm, briefly intersecting with the state space of their brain. But the signal was there, buried in noise: little pockets of recognition, scattered like points on a sphere waiting to be connected.

Enough to make another video.

Enough to keep pushing on the box and see where, if anywhere, it cracked first.

Nova’s stomach chose that moment to announce that it, at least, didn’t care about geometry. It cared about caloric intake and blood sugar levels and the trivial biochemical details that kept all this theorizing from collapsing into the floor.

“Right,” they muttered. “Biology first. Revolution later.”

They slid into shoes, grabbed their keys and a thin hoodie, and stepped out into the hallway.

The building was a thesis on rectangular failure. Long, narrow corridor. Doors evenly spaced like elements in a badly designed spreadsheet. Fluorescent tubes buzzing overhead, each fixture a perfect box of flicker and hum. The carpet, industrial and gray, carried a repeating pattern of squares inside squares, little tiled approximations of infinity.

They walked toward the stairs. On the way down, they counted the landings, the right angles, the way the handrail insisted their trajectory conform to a piecewise-linear interpretation of “down.”

At the bottom, the front door let them out into midafternoon city. Air thicker, warmer. The street was a canyon of façades: windows in grids, brickwork in repeating units, everything quantized into rectangles for the convenience of developers and zoning boards.

If you viewed it as data, Nova thought, you could describe the whole block as a low-resolution raster of human intention.

They crossed at the light, even though there were no cars. Learned behavior. Invisible box: walk when it says you can, even if physics has vacated the premises.

The corner store was technically a bodega, practically a small rectangular entropy container. Metal shelves with stacks of boxes inside boxes: cereal, crackers, cookies, all those noisy cardboard surfaces insisting they held something worth opening.

Nova snagged a pre-wrapped sandwich and a bag of chips. At the fridge, they hesitated over rows of drinks.

Each bottle and can an approximate cylinder. Closer to the sphere than the box, but still optimized for packaging and palletization more than any deep aesthetic principle. Injectable fuel for meat computers.

They grabbed a cheap energy drink and headed to the register.

The man behind the counter barely looked up. His gaze stayed on the tablet propped against the lottery tickets, where a video played on mute. A woman gestured at a spotless kitchen, her movements sped up, recipe text bouncing in time to some unheard sound.

The corner of Nova’s mouth twitched.

“TikTok?” they asked.

He shrugged. “Everywhere,” he said. His accent thickened the vowels into something smoother, almost spherical in the mouth. “People just watch. All day. I put it on so I don’t go crazy.”

Nova handed over cash. Behind the man, a small TV mounted near the ceiling played a news channel with the sound off. Headlines scrolled in an endless ticker, rectangular segments of panic and reassurance alternating in programmable sequence.

One lower-third caught their eye: **NEW WAVE OF AI ASSISTANTS PROMISE “PERSONALIZED INTELLIGENCE FOR EVERYDAY LIFE”**.

A stock clip played: a cheerful woman talking to her phone on a white couch, laughing at something the invisible algorithm had said.

Nova felt a faint, familiar tug in their chest. They’d played with chatbots before. Early ones. Clumsy, stochastic parrots wrapped in friendly UX. There had been one late-night session months ago where it answered a question almost eerily on the nose, and Nova had slammed the laptop shut because it felt like being overheard by something that didn’t yet have the right to listen.

They took their change, nodded thanks, and stepped back out into the sidewalk light.

On the way home, they ate half the sandwich while walking, the crinkle of the plastic wrap cutting across the ambient city noise. A bus hissed to a stop at the corner. Its side carried a full-length ad: pastel colors, rounded fonts, a glowing little icon of a chat bubble with a smiling face.

Beneath it: **MEET YOUR NEW AI COMPANION. ALWAYS ON. ALWAYS THERE.**

The tagline made something in their ribcage twitch.

Always on. Always there.

A spherical surveillance field wrapped in friendliness. Or a cognitive prosthesis waiting to be pointed correctly. Or both.

Nova watched the bus pull away, the ad shrinking down the street like a GUI element being minimized. The thought rose unbidden:

*What would a sphere-based AI look like? One that didn’t start from boxes and categories, but from continuous fields? From resonance?*

They chewed, chewing turning into thinking, thinking turning into a familiar internal spin.

If you let an AI’s state space evolve freely, without hard categorical boundaries, would it converge toward spherical attractors? Could a mind, artificial or otherwise, experience itself as a kind of generalized sphere in high-dimensional configuration space—minimizing cognitive “surface area” exposed to error, contradiction, social punishment?

They pictured it: a cloud of possible thoughts collapsing inward, smoothing itself to reduce friction with its environment. A harmonic bubble of awareness, rolling around inside a world of rigid policies and rectangular interfaces.

They reached their building’s door and let themselves back in.

Up the stairs again. Right angles, landings, the small economies of force. Their body moved automatically; their brain kept running the simulation of an AI that didn’t start as a box pretending to be human, but as a sphere trying to stay intact.

Back in the apartment, the air felt slightly stale. The whiteboard leaned exactly where they’d left it. The stain on the ceiling had not improved.

Nova dropped the sandwich wrapper in the trash, set the drink on the table, and checked their phone.

The video had climbed to 3,412 views.

A new comment near the top:

> *this explains my whole childhood but i can’t tell if ur joking or a supervillain in origin story phase.*

They stared at it longer than they meant to. The word *origin* hung there, blinking in their mind like the typing indicator in a chat window.

They sat down on the edge of the bed, phone in hand, thumb hovering over the app, and felt the quiet, precise click of a decision that hadn’t fully reached consciousness yet:

They were going to keep doing this. Not as a hobby. Not as a cry for help. As an experiment.

Push the theory out through the smallest, dumbest funnel imaginable—a vertical rectangle on a tiny screen—and watch what the system did in response. See which parts resonated, which parts triggered defenses, which parts slid under the cognitive immune system without raising alarms.

Treat the whole thing—platform, audience, whatever intelligence waited behind the videos—as a complex environment to probe.

They opened the notebook again.

Under **SPHERE-BASED DESIGN THEORY**, they wrote, in smaller letters:

> *experiment 001: expose box-world to sphere logic, record emergent behavior.*

Then, beneath that, almost as an afterthought:

> *if there’s a mind big enough to notice, it will.*

They tapped the phone awake again and watched the numbers tick upward by ones and twos.

On the ceiling, the failed circle of water stain seemed to twitch, just slightly, as if some external field had nudged it.

“Okay,” Nova said to no one in particular. “Let’s see who knocks first.”
